# muscala
A music theory library implemented in Scala

## Background

This is a music theory library inspired by Python's 
[mingus](https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus), which aims to take musical 
concepts such as notes and keys, and represent them in a Scala-oriented library.
Unlike other music theory libraries, this library attempts to represent
these concepts in a Scala-esque manner by using both object-oriented and
functional programming concepts.

This project is also a hobby of mine as I learn more about music theory! I will
occasionally visit this library and add new concepts that I learn.
